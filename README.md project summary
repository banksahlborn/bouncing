What did you think about this project? I think that I got a decent amount of help on this project which was very good for helping me to understand this code. I think I initially picked a hard topic so i narrowed it down a bit more and made diffrent shapes come (squares and circles) while hitting the space bar. I think coding all the diffrent collisions were a bit challenging but I eventually got it.
